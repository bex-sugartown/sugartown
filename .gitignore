# Migration artifacts — large export/import files are gitignored
# The artifacts/ directory itself is tracked via artifacts/.gitkeep
# Scripts, manifests, and reports that ARE committed are listed below as exceptions.
artifacts/wp_export.ndjson
artifacts/sanity_import.ndjson
# Keep these — small enough to commit, needed for audit trail:
# artifacts/image_manifest.json      ← commit: maps WP URLs to Sanity asset refs
# artifacts/image_failures.csv       ← commit: audit of failed image transfers
# artifacts/slug_collision_report.csv ← commit: slug resolution audit
# artifacts/parity_report.md         ← commit: cutover validation report
# artifacts/migration_report.json    ← commit: machine-readable parity data
# wp_urls.csv from export-wp-urls.py:
scripts/wp_urls.csv
